### Angles:
All angles are internally represented in radians.  
conversions at input and output.  
Two different angle systems:
1. Cardinal system, north is 0, increases clockwise
2. Local system, the bow (front of boat) is 0, increases clockwise from starboard to port

### Distances:
Meters

### Positions:
2d Cartesian meter grid centered at a point of our choice

### Masses:
Kilograms

### Time:
Seconds

## Synthesized units:
Just use combinations of previously defined units.  
Examples:
1. Velocity: m/s
2. Force: Newtons which are Kg*m/s^2
3. Surface area: m^2
4. Volume: m^3
5. Density: kg/m^3
6. Angular velocity: Radiants per second
7. Torque: Newton-meter
